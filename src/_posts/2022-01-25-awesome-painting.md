I'll tell you the process of making it.

First I did darker colors on the bottom very gently. Then I did a bit more roughly on the lighter colors. Then I filled in whites or even lighter colors in the other spots. Then I swirled it all around and then got black and made a G.

That is the description.

Sorry I haven't posted in a while, but if you want my new artwork, I'm selling it for **$50** because it's an abstract painting. Thank you to whoever buys my painting!
